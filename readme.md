# Express.js: Note Taker

## Description
This project was to create an note taking application using Express.js for a small business owner. This Note Taker application can write and save notes so that the business owner can organise their thoughts and keep track of all their tasks. The key features of this application are that the user can write notes, save notes (or clear the note if they don't want to save it), display saved notes and delete notes.
